# UGent Business Informatics Research group

The UGent Business Informatics research group is part of the department of Business Informatics and Operations Management within the faculty of Economics and Business Management of Ghent University.

The UGent Business Informatics research vision has been translated into “Business Architecture, Analytics, and Process Management”. It consists of four interrelated research clusters:

- Enterprise Modelling & Architecture, coordinated by Prof. dr. Poels
- BPM – Technological perspective, coordinated by Prof. dr. Gailly
- BPM – Organizational perspective, coordinated by Prof. dr. Van Looy
- Business Analytics, coordinated by Prof. dr vanden Broucke

Across these clusters, different themes have been identified on which (future) research may particularly focus, such as SMEs, Manufacturing Industry, public sector, healthcare, service sector, business-IT consultancy and disruptive technologies. Every theme has one or more expert(s) within the UGent Business Informatics research group.
